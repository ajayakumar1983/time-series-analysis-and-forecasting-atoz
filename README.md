## What is Time Series ?
**Time Series** is a sequence of well-defined data points measured at consistent time intervals over a period of time. Data collected on an ad-hoc basis or irregularly does not form a time series.

### Attributes of a Time Series

- It's over a continuous time interval
- There are sequential measurements across that interval
- There is equal spacing between every two consecutive measurements
- Each time unit within the time interval has at most one data point

## What is Time Series Analysis ?
**Time series analysis** comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data.

## What is Time Series Forecasting ?
**Time series forecasting** is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
## What is Time Series Segmentation ?
**Time-series segmentation** is a method of time-series analysis in which an input time-series is divided into a sequence of discrete segments in order to reveal the underlying properties of its source.
